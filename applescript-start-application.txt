Create a applescript with the code. Export to an app.
Place the *.app in same folder as script.sh

Now when running (double click in finder) the script will start.
It will grab menu, exclude file and create (if enabled) authenticate file in same directory.
This will happen every time it's started.

		set the bounds of the front window to {50, 50, 900, 600}
		set folder_path to quoted form of theWin
		do script "cd " & folder_path & ";clear" in window 1
		do script folder_path & "script.sh" in window 1
		#st run_cmd to "/bin/bash " & folder_path & "/bash.sh"
		#d script run_cmd
		#		do shell script "bash app.sh"
	end tell
